The scn format is used by:
- the nd stepper to store/load histories;
- the selt model checker to save counter examples for replay by the stepper;
- the plan application, to analyse path timing.


A  .scn file is  a series  of line,  each constituted  of a  series of
blocks of one  of the following shape (all blocks in  a file have same
shape) :

       <transition>
  or:  <transition>@<time>
  or:  <transition>$<time>

  where <transition> is a transition name (see net.txt)
  and   <time> is a nonnegative float (without exponent)


Spaces and tabs are considered separators;

Line breaks are  significant, thet are interpreted as  marks by the nd
stepper, and preserved by the plan tool;

Blank lines and and those beginning with "#" are considered comments;
