Format .tpn  is a preliminary  script language for building  nets from
net components specified in .net or .ndr format.


Syntax of tpn files:
--------------------

A .tpn file is constituted of zero or more lines

	.tpn ::= <tpnline>*

each line is either any line allowed in a .net or .ndr file, or a tpn command:

	tpnline ::=
		  <trdesc>	(as in .net or .ndr formats)
		| <pldesc>	(as in .net or .ndr formats)
		| <lbdesc>	(as in .net or .ndr formats)
		| <prdesc>	(as in .net or .ndr formats)
		| <netdesc>	(as in .net or .ndr formats)
		| <tpncmd>
	tpncmd ::=
		  'new'
		| 'dup'
		| 'load' TPNFILE
		| 'ren' <renlist>
		| 'merge' INT
		| 'sync' INT
		| 'chain' INT
		| 'source' FILE
	renlist ::= <labpair> <renlist> | <labpair>
	labpair ::= <label>"/"<label> | "/"<label>
	label ::= a label (as in .net or .ndr formats)
	TPNFILE ::= the name of a .net or .ndr file
	FILE ::= the name of a .net, .ndr, or .tpn file

Note that, syntactically, .net and  .ndr files are .tpn files. The tpn
format extends both  the .net and .ndr formats, but  it has no graphic
interpretation at the moment (a future .tdr format might provide that).


Interpretation of tpn scripts:
------------------------------

A  tpn  file describes  a  Time  Petri  net, possibly  resulting  from
composition of several Time Petri nets.

Tpn scripts  are interpreted  as code for  an abstract  stack machine.
The stack  initially holds  the empty Time  Petri net.  The  result of
evaluation  of  a tpn  script  is  the net  on  top  of  the stack  at
completion of interpretation.

The lines  of a tpn file  are interpreted as follows  ("top" means the
net in topmost position on stack):

new			pushes an empty net on stack
.net or .ndr line	extends top with the .net or .ndr declaration
dup			pushes on stack a copy of top
ren R1 ... Rn		applies relabelling R1 ... Rn to top
merge n			replaces n topmost nets by their concurrent composition
sync n			replaces n topmost nets by their synchronization
chain n			replaces n topmost nets by their chaining
source file		evaluates commands from file tpnfile
load tpnfile		pushes the empty net on stack, then sources tpnfile

note:
- merge n, sync n, chain n, assign unique names to the nodes in their components;
- concurrent composition is simply juxtaposition, preserving labels;
- synchronization fuse copies of transitions with same label in all components;
- chaining is like synchronization, but on places;
- merge is a derived form, could always be replaced by some relabelling and sync (see examples)
- ren x/y means that all nodes labelled by y become labelled by x
- ren /x means that nodes labelled x become unlabelled (hidden)
- in a ren specification, all renamings and/or hidings are applied simultaneously
- "load tpnfile" is a shorthand for the two lines:
	empty
	source tpnfile
- the file names in source and load instructions are relative to the directory
  in which resides the script file;


Examples:
---------

See files <tinahome>/nets/tpn_examples/* for some script examples.

3-trains example:

load train.ndr
load train.ndr
load train.ndr
merge 3
load controler.ndr
load barrier.ndr
sync 3
ren /App /Exit /Up /Down

equivalent to:

load train.ndr
dup
dup
merge 3
load controler.ndr
load barrier.ndr
sync 3
ren /App /Exit /Up /Down

equivalent to:

net train
tr App [0,w[ Far -> Close
lb App App
tr Exit [0,0] Left -> Far
lb Exit Exit
tr In [20,30] Close -> On
tr Ex [30,50] On -> Left
pl Far (1)
dup
dup
merge 3
new
net controler
tr A1 [0,w[ far*3 -> Coming in far*2
lb A1 App
tr E1 [0,0] in far*2 -> Leaving far*3
lb E1 Exit
tr A2 [0,w[ in far -> in*2
lb A2 App
tr E2 [0,0] in*2 -> far in
lb E2 Exit
tr D [0,0] Coming ->
lb D Down
tr U [0,0] Leaving ->
lb U Up
pl far (3)
new
net barrier
tr D1 [0,0] Up -> lowering
lb D1 Down
tr D2 [0,0] raising -> lowering
lb D2 Down
tr L [5,10] lowering -> Down
tr U [0,0] Down -> raising
lb U Up
tr R [5,10] raising -> Up
pl Up (1)
sync 3
ren /App /Exit /Up /Down
