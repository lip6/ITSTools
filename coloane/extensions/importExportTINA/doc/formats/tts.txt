As  of 2.9.0,  tina accepts  as input  high level  descriptions called
"Time Transition Systems" (TTS).  A Time Transition System description
consists of  a Time  Petri net described  in any format  understood by
tina (.net, .ndr,  .tpn, .pnml) and a shared  library (a .so/.dyn/.dll
file)  defining   the  data  processing  synchronized   with  the  net
transitions, together in a directory with extension .tts.

Applied to  a .tts  directory, tina  loads the .net  or .ndr  file (as
usual), and dynamically links the  library file to get the actions and
predicates. This file described the API the shared library must obey.


tina sees data values  as keys (integers, not necessarily contiguous),
through a  "store" function.   The storage functions  may reside  in a
separate library  or may be  statically linked with the  data library,
all storage libraries must provide functions:

	store : value -> key
	lookup : key -> value
	init_storage : unit -> unit


The data shared library itself captures:

    an array of transition names for the transitions referred to
    in the library:

	transitions : int ref -> string vector

    for a subset of transitions in transitions, referred to by
    their index in the above vector:

	pre_i : key -> bool
	act_i : key -> key

    An independance predicate for actions:

        independant : int * int -> bool

    This predicate is used by tina for computing the conflicting relation
    for partial order methods, and the persistent and newly enabled relations
    for state class graphs:

    A value printer, used by tina to print data value in some concrete
    notation when output is "verbose":

	sprint_state: key * string ref -> int

    For kts output, the state (or some abstraction of it) should be 
    available to tina as a record with integer fields. This is done
    by providing:

    A vector of observation labels, and the number of, by function:

	obs_names : int ref -> string vector

    A function to retrieve the contents of observables from a value:

	obs_values : key -> int vector


Please contact the authors of tina if you wish more details on this format.
A first high level description language compiled into this format, called
Fiacre, should be available soon.
