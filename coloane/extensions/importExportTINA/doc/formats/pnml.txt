The PNML  format is  still evolving. The  tina tools  currently accept
BasicPNML   (http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/pnml/basicPNML.rng)
and an extension of it,  TpnPNML, explained below (a rng specification
is forthcoming).


TpnPNML extends BasicPNML as follows:

- In the "graphics" element of any node, the following line can be added,
  that specifies an offset for the node identifier:

   <offset x=... y=... />

- Any transition can have a "delay" element, encoding a firing interval,
  and possibly an offset for this interval. The syntax of intervals is
  taken from MathML (http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathM).

  For instance, an interval [4,9] with offset (-10,0) is specified by:

  <delay>
   <interval xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" closure="closed">
    <cn>4</cn>
    <cn>9</cn>
   </interval>
   <graphics>
    <offset x="-10" y="0" />
   </graphics>
  </delay>

  The unbounded interval [4,w[ would be specified by:

  <delay>
   <interval xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" closure="closed-open">
    <cn>4</cn>
    <ci>infty</ci>
   </interval>
  </delay>

  And interval ]3,5[ by:

  <delay>
   <interval xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" closure="open">
    <cn>3</cn>
    <cn>5</cn>
   </interval>
  </delay>



Tools tina, struct and plan accept BasicPNML and TpnPNML natively.

The nd  tool can import or export  nets into TpnPNML. If  the file has
extension .pnml, then "file->open" and "file->save as" can be used for
this, otherwise use "file->import" or "file->export".

The ndrio tool is able to convert .net and .ndr to/from .pnml.


IMPORTANT NOTICE:

When  importing  or  exporting   nets  from/to  PNML,  the  PNML  node
identifiers (id attributes)  are mapped to tina names,  and PNML names
are mapped to tina labels.

Converting pnml into  net or ndr should never  fail, but conversion of
net or  ndr to pnml  will fail  if the tina  names are not  legal PNML
identifiers (class ID of xml). In  that case, one may first rename the
nodes in the .net or .ndr file using ndrio with option -r. This option
duplicates the net, assigning new  names for the nodes, saving the old
names as labels.
