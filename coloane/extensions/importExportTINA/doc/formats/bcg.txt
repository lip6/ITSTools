Format .bcg:
------------

It is the lts description format  of the BCG tools of the CADP toolset
(see the CADP documents).

NOTE: tina forbids  double quotes (") and backquotes  (`) to appear in
.bcg labels. Backquotes are used by tina to encode lists of properties
into  single  .bcg  labels;   double  quotes  would  prevent  lossless
conversions to .aut.
