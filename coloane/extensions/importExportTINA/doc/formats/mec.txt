------------

It is the kts description format of the Mec4 model checker.

NOTE:  mec  only allows  alphanumeric  labels  (a  letter followed  by
letters,   digits   or  _)   to   appear   as   state  or   transition
properties. tina will refuse to generate .mec descriptions if place or
transition names are not legal mec property identifiers.
