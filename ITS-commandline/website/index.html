<h1> Download page for ITS tools command line</h1>

<p> Despite the ui integration of ITS-Tools with Eclipse being very nice, many scenarios involve calling the ITS-tools as part of a process, thus are easier to write and maintain using the command line.
Plus some people just think eclipse is bloated and over-complex or have never used it, adopting it because of ITS-tools is too much.
However ITS-tools leverages many components of the eclipse platform, notably EMF and XText which made extracting our code a bit of an issue.

<p>
So due to popular demand, we are happy to present the ITS-tools command line support, that allows to do everything we could from Eclipse, but using a plain command line and with minimal download/install hassle.

</ul>
