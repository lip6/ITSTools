/**
 * This package contains support for Trace Abstraction Refinement.
 * It is based on the implementation of these concepts in Tapaal
 * mostly written by Peter G. Jensen, with additions from other members of
 * the Tapaal team.
 * See the src/PetriEngine/TAR folders of Tapaal verifypn source code for more details.
 * https://github.com/TAPAAL/verifypn
 *
 * This code is clearly a derivative and remains covered by GPL v3 of Tapaal release.
 * This is fine since ITS-Tools is released under GPLv3 too.
 *
 * Adaptation to ITS-Tools and Java by Yann Thierry-Mieg started in Nov 2022.
